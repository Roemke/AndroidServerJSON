Small Server based on nanoHTTPD

Service is started on startup of phone.

Server is listening on port 8080. If you access like http://localost/<anything> you get 
a small webpage with some information. 

If you access  http://localhost/getJSON you get a json string with two 
informations: phone battery isCharging and phone battery level

used to access from pebble js to get information of battery level on android phone.
