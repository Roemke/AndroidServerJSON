Quick and dirty webserver to answer pebblekit js answers to local webservice.
in the moment no configuration (port is fixed to 8080)

ask for battery=1 - get json object with battery value
otherwise get html-page with some status information

I have no experience with Android programming and java is 15 years ago 
so - there might be bugs :-)

state: it works so far, the nano http-Server is included 
can start and stop via buttons 

connection fromm pebble js via XmlHTTPRequest works
